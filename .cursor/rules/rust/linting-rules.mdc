# Rust Linting Rules for DaemonEye

This document explains the intent behind each clippy lint rule in DaemonEye's Cargo.toml. These rules are carefully chosen for a security-critical process monitoring system and should not be disabled without understanding their purpose.

## Critical Security Rules (FORBIDDEN)

## Summary

These linting rules are carefully chosen for a security-critical process monitoring system. Each rule serves a specific purpose in preventing security vulnerabilities, ensuring performance, and maintaining code quality. They should not be disabled without understanding their intent and the security implications of doing so.

## AI Assistant Restrictions

**CRITICAL**: AI assistants are explicitly prohibited from removing clippy restrictions or allowing linters marked as `deny` without explicit permission. All `-D warnings` and `deny` attributes must be preserved. Any changes to linting configuration require explicit user approval.
