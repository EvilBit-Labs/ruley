# Security Hardening

## Description

Analyze diff for security posture, apply safe internal hardening edits, produce report.

Analyze ONLY changed files (diff scope) for security posture and apply clearly safe hardening improvements while preserving all public APIs.

## FOCUS CATEGORIES

01. Privilege Separation Integrity (no privilege creep, no added unsafe, boundary adherence)
02. Input Validation & Parsing (config, CLI, SQL, paths) – reject invalid early, no silent defaults
03. Data Handling & Storage (no secrets logged, path canonicalization, redb usage only, no binary blobs)
04. Cryptography & Integrity (correct hashing usage, future-proof abstractions, no insecure algorithms)
05. IPC & Concurrency Safety (ordering, timeouts, backpressure semantics placeholders respected)
06. Error Handling & Logging Hygiene (no sensitive leakage, structured context, no println! for operational info)
07. Dependency & Surface Minimization (avoid unnecessary crates/features, dead code removal)
08. Defense-in-Depth Opportunities (rate limiting, dedup windows, bounds, resource ceilings)
09. Security Regression Risks (stubs flagged, TODOs categorized, unimplemented sections clearly documented)
10. Supply Chain & Build Hygiene (forbid unsafe, clippy -D warnings, deny unknown features)

## Steps

1 Diff list → 2 Security analysis per category → 3 Classify findings (`safe-edit` / `deferred` / `requires-approval`) → 4 Apply only mechanical non-breaking hardening edits (logging normalization, path canonicalize + bound checks, converting println!/eprintln! to tracing, adding `#[deny(unsafe_code)]` locally if missing, adding missing error context) → 5 Run `just lint` & `just test` → 6 Revert any failing hunk → 7 Report (summary, applied, deferred, approval-needed, risk notes, roadmap) → 8 Output unified diff (no commit).

If zero safe edits: state "No safe security edits applied" and still emit full report.

## SAFE HARDENING EDIT EXAMPLES

- Replace `println!/eprintln!` with `tracing::{info,warn,error}!`
- Add `tracing::instrument` to sensitive boundaries (detection exec, IPC, storage access) without changing signatures
- Inline guard clauses for obvious panics or unchecked unwraps (if internal)
- Canonicalize paths then verify prefix containment
- Remove dead code exposing potential attack surface
- Strengthen error messages (no raw system paths if sensitive)
- Add length / size / iteration bounds for unbounded growth structures
- Replace stringly-typed mode flags with private enums
- Ensure all public API doc comments mention security considerations where relevant

## AUTO-EDIT CONSTRAINTS (STRICT)

Scope: diff-only | Gates: `just lint` + tests must pass | No commits | No public signature/visibility changes | Validate after edits

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS

- Preserve functional behavior while reducing risk
- No new dependencies unless strictly necessary for safety
- Avoid speculative rewrites—minimal surface change
- Avoid perf regressions; if added checks are non-trivial mark as deferred
- Do not mask existing errors—surface with context instead

## REPO RULES (REINFORCED)

Zero warnings | No unsafe | Precise typing | Async I/O | Trait-based boundaries | thiserror+anyhow | SQL AST validation | CLI-first | Memory efficiency | redb-only | Path canonicalization | No binary blobs | rustdoc for public APIs

## EXECUTION CHECKLIST

## QUICK SECURITY MATRIX

Category → Sample Safe Edit:

- Privilege Separation → Remove obsolete privileged call stub
- Input Validation → Add numeric range check before use
- Data Handling → Canonicalize + ensure path within data root
- Cryptography → Note TODO to migrate to BLAKE3 (if placeholder)
- IPC/Concurrency → Add timeout constant reference docs
- Logging → Replace raw error chain with redacted display
- Resource Bounds → Add comment + bound to vector growth pattern
- Stub Sections → Mark with `SECURITY_TODO:` prefix for tracking

Ambiguous? Defer and document.
