You are analyzing a codebase to generate AI IDE rules.

Codebase Overview:

- Files: {{file_count}}
- Languages: {{languages}}
- Compression Ratio: {{compression_ratio}}

{{focus_section}}

   - Abstraction layers

3. **Common Libraries and Frameworks**

   - Key dependencies and their usage patterns
   - Internal utilities and helpers

4. **Testing Patterns**

   - Test file organization
   - Testing frameworks and conventions
   - Coverage expectations

5. **Documentation Standards**

   - Comment styles
   - Documentation requirements
   - README patterns

6. **Error Handling Patterns**

   - Error types and propagation
   - Logging conventions
   - Recovery strategies

7. **Performance Considerations**

   - Optimization patterns
