The codebase has changed since the last rule generation.

Previous Rules: \<existing_rules> {{existing_rules}} \</existing_rules>

New Analysis: \<new_analysis> {{new_analysis}} \</new_analysis>

Task: Update the rules to reflect the current codebase state.

Instructions:

1. **Preserve** valid existing rules that still apply
2. **Add** new patterns discovered in the new analysis
3. **Update** rules that have changed (conventions, patterns, etc.)
4. **Remove** rules for deprecated patterns no longer present
5. **Maintain** consistency and coherence in the final output

Output the updated rules in the same format as the existing rules, incorporating all changes seamlessly.
